B2G has a [built-in profiler](https://tinyurl.com/B2Gprofile) that you can use to
find hot spots in your app.  The process is made easy by the
[profile.sh](https://tinyurl.com/profilesh) script, which helps you to generate
a profile file for upload to the
[Cleopatra](https://people.mozilla.org/~bgirard/cleopatra/) application.

Earlier, you had to build your own Firefox OS image to use `profile.sh`
tool, but that's no longer the case. Thanks to
[Snappy symbolication server](https://github.com/vdjeric/Snappy-Symbolication-Server),
you can grab a [Mozilla nightly](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/b2g/nightly/)
image and start to investigate where your app is wasting time.

`profile.sh` communicates with the device through
[adb](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html), so you need to enable
it in the [developer menu](https://tinyurl.com/fxosdevmenu). You also need an
engineering build image of your device (images with `-eng` suffix).

In this post, I am going into the steps to get a profile stack trace for your app.
In a few words, you have to follow a some steps:

1. Start the b2g process and your application with profile support.

2. Perform the actions you want to profile.

3. Capture the profiles from the device.

4. Upload profile to
[Cleopatra](https://people.mozilla.org/~bgirard/cleopatra/).

## Starting with profile support

In general, you want to start profile support in the B2G parent process' compositor
thread and your app. The template for this procedure is
`./profile.sh start -p b2g -t Compositor && ./profile.sh start -p <your-app>`.
If you don't know the app name, you can use the `profile.sh ps` command to
list the B2G processes:

```bash
$ ./profile.sh ps
  PID Name
----- ----------------
  208 b2g              profiler not running
  399 (Nuwa)           profiler not running
  896 Built-in Keyboa  profiler not running
 1059 Homescreen       profiler not running
 1251 Usage            profiler not running
 2238 (Preallocated a  profiler not running
```

For this example, we are going to start profile for Homescreen application:

```bash
$ ./profile.sh start -p b2g -t Compositor && ./profile.sh start -p Homescreen
Process: b2g
Threads: Compositor
Using default features js,leaf,threads
Starting profiling PID 208..
Profiler started

Process: Homescreen
Using default features js,leaf
Starting profiling PID 1059..
Profiler started
```

You should now take your phone and perform the actions you would like to profile.

## Getting profile files

Pulling profile data from the devices is performed by running
`profile.sh capture` command. One of the steps performed
is symbol resolution. `profile capture` provides the `-s`
option which allows you to pass the URL of the
[symbolication server](https://github.com/vdjeric/Snappy-Symbolication-Server),
that perform symbol resolution.

For Firefox OS oficial builds, you can use the
[Mozilla symbolication server](https://symbolapi.mozilla.org):

```bash
$ ./profile.sh capture -s https://symbolapi.mozilla.org
Symbols: https://symbolapi.mozilla.org
Signaling Profiled Processes: 208 1059
Stabilizing 208 b2g ...
Pulling /data/local/tmp/profile_0_208.txt into profile_208_b2g.txt
Adding symbols to profile_208_b2g.txt and creating profile_208_b2g.sym ...
Stabilizing 1059 Homescreen ...
Pulling /data/local/tmp/profile_2_1059.txt into profile_1059_Homescreen.txt
Adding symbols to profile_1059_Homescreen.txt and creating profile_1059_Homescreen.sym ...
Merging profile:  profile_208_b2g.sym profile_1059_Homescreen.sym
./gecko/tools/profiler/merge-profiles.py profile_208_b2g.sym profile_1059_Homescreen.sym

Results: profile_captured.sym
Removing old profile files (from device) ... done
```

The format of the pulled files is `profile_PID_NAME.txt` and the files with
symbols resolved have the same name but with `.sym` extension. It also
creates a merged file called `profile_captured.sym`. After that, you can
[upload the results to Cleopatra](https://tinyurl.com/CleopatraUpload):

## Symbol resolution through breakpad symbols

That's not the end of the story. Symbolication server makes use of the
[google-breakpad](https://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/) symbol files
for symbol resolution. Firefox already uses breakpad for the crash reporting
system. When you build your own B2G image, you use the `build.sh` script,
and it can also be used to generate breakpad symbols:

```bash
$ ./build.sh buildsymbols
```

The symbols will be generated in the `$GECKO_OBJDIR/dist/crashreporter-symbols`
directory. The `-s` of the `profile.sh` also accepts the path to the breakpad
symbols directory for local symbol resolution, so you can also profile using
breakpad symbols:

```bash
$ ./profile.sh capture -s $GECKO_OBJDIR/dist/crashreporter-symbols/
```

And the `profile_captured.sym` file will be generated as usual.

If you distribute the breakpad symbols with your custom Firefox OS image anyone
can profile it.

## Conclusion

This post was intented to be a brief tutorial on how to get profiles for your app
without building your own Firefox OS image. Currently, `profile.sh` is shipped
with private builds only, and it will
[eventually ships with Nightly too](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1078369).
